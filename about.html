            My name is Marilyn Lush and I am a qualified and BACP accredited counsellor
            based in Portsmouth.
          </h1>

        <article class="about-story">
          <h2>Why I Became a Counsellor</h2>

          <p>
            I am a fully qualified and experienced BACP Accredited Counsellor and
            Psychotherapist with an Enhanced DBS Certificate. I offer a warm,
            supportive and professional counselling service, working sensitively
            alongside my clients and always at their pace.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work within the BACP Ethical Framework and am deeply committed to
            Continuing Professional Development. I see clients at my Southsea or
            Fareham venues, whichever is most convenient, and I also offer online
            counselling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many people come to counselling feeling lost, low, anxious, angry or
            overwhelmed. Counselling can feel like untangling a ball of knotted
            wool — gently working through what feels stuck so that clarity,
            understanding and inner peace can begin to return.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work by walking alongside my clients as they explore, examine and
            challenge the issues and emotions that arise. Together, we create a
            space where you feel heard, understood and supported, enabling you to
            move forward emotionally and regain a sense of balance and wellbeing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work successfully with adults, couples and young people across all
            age ranges, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
          </p>
        </article>

        <aside class="about-qualifications">
          <h2>Qualifications</h2>

          <p>
            I hold a Diploma in Humanistic Counselling alongside EMDR Certificates
            Parts 1, 2 and 3 approved by the EMDR Europe Association. I also hold
            advanced qualifications in Couples and Relationship Counselling,
            Counselling and Guidance, and Education.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am proactive in keeping my knowledge and skills up to date and
            regularly undertake further training. Recent areas of study include
            trauma therapy, psychological first aid, emotional resilience,
            attachment, bereavement and loss, domestic violence, mindfulness and
            information governance in line with NHS confidentiality guidelines.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have worked as a counsellor since 2001 and have extensive experience
            supporting individuals, couples and young people across the full age
            range.

        <h2>Accreditations &amp; Professional Standards</h2>

        <p>
          I am a Registered and Accredited Member of the British Association for

          level of professional training, experience, and a commitment to ethical
          practice.
